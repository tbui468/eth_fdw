GOAL:
    Read ethereum block chain with SQL
        make blocks table
        make transactions table
        make addresses table

    Finish reading in blocks.json file and printing out single lines for now

    Look at blackhole_fdw.c for stubs to add to code
    Look at postgresql_fdw.c for tips on how to connect to networked databases
    Look at file_fdw.c for examples of how to structure program


    Issue with totalDifficulty column - INT8 (largest not including NUMERIC) doesn't fit the number
        Need a way of converting number in blocks.json totalDifficulty attribute to a NUMERIC type, 
        then all NumericGetDatum(n);

        What is Numeric vs NumericVar?

    Add options for fdw
        Number of blocks to query from or send request to infura to download newest blocks
        Look at blackhole_fdw.c for tips on options validator

    Query ethereum/infura directly instead of writing to disk first
        Check postgresql_fdw to see how network requests are sent and data retrieved
            connection.c/h
